### EXERCISES ###
# 1)
# a) With the initial guess of p0 = 1.5, how many iterations does it take for the fixed point 
# iteration to converge with an absolute tolerance of 10âˆ’10?
# 
# with the initial guess of p0 = 1.5 it takes 12 iterations to converge with an absolute tolerance of 1e-10

# (b) Use the technique to developed in problem 1 to determine the order of convergence of
# the fixed point method. (You know this from class but it is good to practice numerically
# finding it.) Also determine the constant associated with this convergence rate.
# 
# the order of convergence is output as alpha = 0.9996909905165663  or appx 1 indicating fixed point converges linearly
# and and the error constant lambda = 0.1265274282031372
